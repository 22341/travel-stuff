## Days 2-5: Tuesday 3rd - Friday 6th November 2026

### Exploring Ljubljana and Beyond

Over the next few days, immerse yourself in Ljubljana's unique charm and explore some of Slovenia's most spectacular attractions.

### Ljubljana City Highlights

Start with a visit to Ljubljana Castle, perched dramatically on a hill overlooking the city. Take the funicular railway up to enjoy panoramic views across the terracotta rooftops to the Julian Alps beyond. The castle itself dates back to the 11th century and houses exhibitions on Slovenian history.

Wander through the atmospheric Old Town, discovering architectural gems like the Triple Bridge and Dragon Bridge, both designed by the renowned architect Jože Plečnik. The Dragon Bridge, with its impressive Art Nouveau dragons, has become an iconic symbol of the city. Visit Prešeren Square, the heart of Ljubljana's social life, dominated by the salmon-pink Franciscan Church of the Annunciation.

Spend time exploring the Central Market along the riverbank, where you can sample local produce, pick up artisan goods, and soak up the vibrant atmosphere. The market's colonnades were also designed by Plečnik and blend beautifully with the riverside setting. Afterwards, relax at one of the many riverside cafés watching the world go by.

Take a leisurely walk through Tivoli Park, Ljubljana's largest green space, with tree-lined paths, gardens, and plenty of open areas perfect for a peaceful stroll. For something more alternative, head to Metelkova Art Centre, a former military barracks transformed into a colourful hub of galleries, street art, and nightlife that showcases Ljubljana's creative side.

Don't miss the opportunity to sample traditional Slovenian cuisine at local restaurants. Try žlikrofi (similar to ravioli, filled with potato and herbs), potica (a delicious rolled cake with nuts), and other regional specialties. Visit wine bars to taste excellent Slovenian wines - the country produces outstanding whites and reds from several distinct wine regions. Consider taking a canal boat tour along the Ljubljanica River for a relaxing way to see the city's beautiful bridges and architecture from a different perspective.

### Day Trip Options

**Lake Bled** (55km north) is Slovenia's most famous and photographed destination, and for good reason. The stunning alpine lake features a fairy-tale island with a church in the centre, reached by traditional wooden boats called pletnas. Bled Castle, perched on cliffs above the lake, offers spectacular views, and you absolutely must try the famous Bled cream cake (kremšnita) at one of the lakeside cafés. The backdrop of the Julian Alps makes this an unforgettable day trip.

**Postojna Cave and Predjama Castle** (50km southwest) can be combined into one spectacular day trip. Postojna Cave is one of Europe's most impressive underground cave systems, with a miniature train taking you deep into vast chambers filled with extraordinary stalactites and stalagmites formed over millions of years. Just 10km away, Predjama Castle is one of the world's most dramatic fortresses - a Renaissance castle ingeniously built into the mouth of a 123-metre-high cliff, creating one of the most photogenic castles you'll ever see.

**Škocjan Caves** (UNESCO World Heritage site, 80km southwest) offers a more dramatic underground experience than Postojna. This magnificent karst cave system features an enormous underground canyon where the Reka River disappears into the depths. The scale and natural beauty of these caves is truly breathtaking.

**Lake Bohinj** (80km northwest) provides a quieter, more pristine alternative to the busier Lake Bled. Set within Triglav National Park, this larger alpine lake is surrounded by mountains and offers a more peaceful atmosphere with fewer tourists. It's perfect if you want to experience Slovenia's natural beauty without the crowds.

## Day 6: Saturday 7th November 2026

### Ljubljana to Manchester to Leeds

Your final morning in Ljubljana - perhaps a last stroll through the Old Town or a final coffee by the river before heading to the airport. Your 10:25am flight departs for Manchester (£58), arriving back in the UK around 11:10am local time after approximately 2 hours 45 minutes in the air. From Manchester, take the train back to Leeds (£10, 1 hour 30 minutes), arriving home in the afternoon with wonderful memories of Slovenia's beautiful capital.
